A guide to Meethub Swift style and conventions.

#### Whitespace

 * 4 spaces for Tabs.
 * End files with a newline.
 * Arithmetical operators are always delimited with spaces
 ```swift
 let y = (x + max(one, two) / 2) * 5
 ```
 * Maximum one whitespace line between logical chunks of code. If it's tempting to add more whitespace lines, consider breaking the code down to multiple methods instead.
 * Don’t leave trailing whitespace.
   * Not even leading indentation on blank lines.
 * All functions should be at least one empty line apart each other.
 * Use single spaces around return arrows (->) both in functions and in closures.  
```swift
func process() -> Int {
    return 1
}
 ```
 * Commas (,) should have no whitespace before it, and should have either one space or one newline after.
 * Colons (:) used to indicate type should have one space after it and should have no whitespace before it.
```swift
func process(a: A, b: B) {
}
```
 * If-then-else
```swift
if nice {
    takeIt()
} else {
    throwAway()
}
```
 * One condition guard on one line
```swift
guard let candy = present as? Candy else { return "not candy at all" }
```

* One condition guard with multiple lines in `else` statement is like that:
```swift
guard let candy = present as? Candy else {
    getMoney()    
    buyCandies()
}
```

 * Multiple conditions guard on multiple lines
```swift
guard
    let candy = present as? Candy,
    let tastyCake = cake as? TastyCake
else {
    return "no party"
}
party()
```

 * When naming types and vars, add Handler suffix to vars and Closure suffix to Types
 ```swift
 class ViewController {
     var completionHandler: CompletionClosure
 }
 ```

 * When using closure-vars in a manner similar to delegate pattern, pass the object itself into it as a param
 ```swift
 class Coordinator {
     var cancelHandler: ((_ coordinator: Coordinator) -> Void)?
 }
 ```

#### Prefer `let`-bindings over `var`-bindings wherever possible

Use `let foo = …` over `var foo = …` wherever possible (and when in doubt). Only use `var` if you absolutely have to (i.e. you *know* that the value might change, e.g. when using the `weak` storage modifier).

_Rationale:_ The intent and meaning of both keywords are clear, but *let-by-default* results in safer and clearer code.

A `let`-binding guarantees and *clearly signals to the programmer* that its value will never change. Subsequent code can thus make stronger assumptions about its usage.

It becomes easier to reason about code. Had you used `var` while still making the assumption that the value never changed, you would have to manually check that.

Accordingly, whenever you see a `var` identifier being used, assume that it will change and ask yourself why.

#### Return and break early

When you have to meet certain criteria to continue execution, try to exit early. So, instead of this:

```swift
if n.isNumber {
    // Use n here
} else {
    return
}
```

use this:
```swift
guard n.isNumber else { return }
// Use n here
```

You can also do it with `if` statement, but using `guard` is preferred, because `guard` statement without `return`, `break` or `continue` produces a compile-time error, so exit is guaranteed.

#### Avoid Using Force-Unwrapping of Optionals

If you have an identifier `foo` of type `FooType?` or `FooType!`, don't force-unwrap it to get to the underlying value (`foo!`) if possible.

Instead, prefer this:

```swift
if let foo = foo {
    // Use unwrapped `foo` value in here
} else {
    // If appropriate, handle the case where the optional is nil
}
```

Alternatively, you might want to use Swift's Optional Chaining in some of these cases, such as:

```swift
// Call the function if `foo` is not nil. If `foo` is nil, ignore we ever tried to make the call
foo?.callSomethingIfFooIsNotNil()
```

_Rationale:_ Explicit `if let`-binding of optionals results in safer code. Force unwrapping is more prone to lead to runtime crashes.

#### Avoid Using Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals

Where possible, use `let foo: FooType?` instead of `let foo: FooType!` if `foo` may be nil (Note that in general, `?` can be used instead of `!`).

_Rationale:_ Explicit optionals result in safer code. Implicitly unwrapped optionals have the potential of crashing at runtime.

#### Always specify access control explicitly for top-level definitions

Top-level functions, types, and variables should always have explicit access control specifiers:

```swift
public var whoopsGlobalState: Int
internal struct TheFez {}
private func doTheThings(things: [Thing]) {}
```

However, definitions within those can leave access control implicit, where appropriate:

```swift
internal struct TheFez {
	var owner: Person = Joshaber()
}
```

_Rationale:_ It's rarely appropriate for top-level definitions to be specifically `internal`, and being explicit ensures that careful thought goes into that decision. Within a definition, reusing the same access control specifier is just duplicative, and the default is usually reasonable.

#### When specifying a type, always associate the colon with the identifier

When specifying the type of an identifier, always put the colon immediately
after the identifier, followed by a space and then the type name.

```swift
class SmallBatchSustainableFairtrade: Coffee { ... }

let timeToCoffee: NSTimeInterval = 2

func makeCoffee(type: CoffeeType) -> Coffee { ... }
```

_Rationale:_ The type specifier is saying something about the _identifier_ so
it should be positioned with it.

#### Only explicitly refer to `self` when required

When accessing properties or methods on `self`, leave the reference to `self` implicit by default:

#### Prefer structs over classes

Unless you require functionality that can only be provided by a class (like identity or deinitializers), implement a struct instead.

Note that inheritance is (by itself) usually _not_ a good reason to use classes, because polymorphism can be provided by protocols, and implementation reuse can be provided through composition.

For example, this class hierarchy:

```swift
class Vehicle {
    let numberOfWheels: Int

    init(numberOfWheels: Int) {
        self.numberOfWheels = numberOfWheels
    }

    func maximumTotalTirePressure(pressurePerWheel: Float) -> Float {
        return pressurePerWheel * Float(numberOfWheels)
    }
}

class Bicycle: Vehicle {
    init() {
        super.init(numberOfWheels: 2)
    }
}

class Car: Vehicle {
    init() {
        super.init(numberOfWheels: 4)
    }
}
```

could be refactored into these definitions:

```swift
protocol Vehicle {
    var numberOfWheels: Int { get }
}

func maximumTotalTirePressure(vehicle: Vehicle, pressurePerWheel: Float) -> Float {
    return pressurePerWheel * Float(vehicle.numberOfWheels)
}

struct Bicycle: Vehicle {
    let numberOfWheels = 2
}

struct Car: Vehicle {
    let numberOfWheels = 4
}
```

_Rationale:_ Value types are simpler, easier to reason about, and behave as expected with the `let` keyword.

#### Make classes `final` by default

Classes should start as `final`, and only be changed to allow subclassing if a valid need for inheritance has been identified. Even in that case, as many definitions as possible _within_ the class should be `final` as well, following the same rules.

_Rationale:_ Composition is usually preferable to inheritance, and opting _in_ to inheritance hopefully means that more thought will be put into the decision.


#### Omit type parameters where possible

Methods of parameterized types can omit type parameters on the receiving type when they’re identical to the receiver’s. For example:

```swift
struct Composite<T> {
	…
	func compose(other: Composite<T>) -> Composite<T> {
		return Composite<T>(self, other)
	}
}
```

could be rendered as:

```swift
struct Composite<T> {
	…
	func compose(other: Composite) -> Composite {
		return Composite(self, other)
	}
}
```

_Rationale:_ Omitting redundant type parameters clarifies the intent, and makes it obvious by contrast when the returned type takes different type parameters.

#### Use whitespace around operator definitions

Use whitespace around operators when defining them. Instead of:

```swift
func <|(lhs: Int, rhs: Int) -> Int
func <|<<A>(lhs: A, rhs: A) -> A
```

write:

```swift
func <| (lhs: Int, rhs: Int) -> Int
func <|< <A>(lhs: A, rhs: A) -> A
```

_Rationale:_ Operators consist of punctuation characters, which can make them difficult to read when immediately followed by the punctuation for a type or value parameter list. Adding whitespace separates the two more clearly.

#### Use /// for Swift Documentation, // for comments

Use triple-slash /// to annotate classes, functions and variables where appropriate.

```swift
/// The following function was so badly thought out that it
/// required a special passage before it.
func nobodyUnderstandsHowItWorks() {
}
```

_Rationale:_ When you feel that a function, class or variable needs to be annotated or explained, such explanation might be useful to be present in Xcode help dialog. For such cases, please, use three-slashes annotation before the declaration itself.
